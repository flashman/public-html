<h5>CURRENT INTERESTS</h5>
<p>The study of complexity is the study of systems 
that demonstrate structure and behavior not simply explained by the systems’ elementary constituents, 
their dynamics or their interactions.  It is this question of emergence of the macroscopic from the 
microscopic that the study of complexity begins to answer.</p>

<p> One important feature of complex systems is their capacity for hierarchical organization. If we 
think about the chemistry of life, it consists of a pool of chemicals floating around and interacting 
according to the laws of physics; let’s take this to be the microscopic description of life. Then the 
creatures of earth, their societies, their thoughts, their reproduction and evolution, are the 
macroscopic structures and behaviors of this chemical system. If this were the perspective of 
complexity science, then the effort would be thoroughly hopeless.</p>

<p>In a rough sense, the characterization of life given above is not incorrect.  But it fails to 
account for the elaborate dynamical process by which chemistry developed into life, and the role of 
intermediary structures and interactions along the way. Specifically, molecules interact according 
to the rules of biochemistry to form structures such as  proteins, DNA, RNA, membranes, etc.  These 
are the macroscopic structures of biochemistry, coherent structures both conceptually in the sense of 
classification, and dynamically in the sense of persistence, resilient to perturbations.  Moreover, 
these structures possess new and unique functional properties, enabling interactions among themselves 
in a new way not available to a purely chemical system.</p>  

<p>The interactions of the coherent chemical structures described above could  be as interesting as 
those of grains of sand tumbling in the surf.  Instead  this is only the first level of organization 
in the vast hierarchy of life.  These coherent structures may interact constructively, to form 
organelles and cells, coherent structures built not out of biochemistry but out of proteins, DNA, RNA,
etc. the macroscopic structures of biochemistry.  And if the cells are sufficiently stable, then they
may interact according to their own set of cell interaction rules to form even larger coherent 
structures, organs like the heart or the brain.  Together the organs interact to form even larger 
coherent structures like people.  And people intern interact according to a whole new set of rules 
(presumably based on brain function) to create societies and economies.  In this way, a complex 
chemical system uses hierarchical structure to lift itself up by the bootstraps.</p>      
  
<p> However, not every complex system support the same hierarchical depth.  Granular system may separate into bands according to size when jostled in a tube.  It's possible to identify these bands as coherent structures unto themselves, stable to perturbation.  And we might try to describe the way that the bands interact.  But unlike the cell described above, the interactions of bands as higher level structures do not induce further levels of organization in the hierarchy. Alternatively, dogs and cats, though built upon the same pillar of life as humans, fail to generate the cultural organizations.  Neither does every complex system demonstrate the dramatic variety of structure and interaction across its levels of organization.  For instance, many real world networks exhibit hierarchical structure in which sets of nodes group together to form communities.  And these communities group together to form larger communities, and so on.  But unlike the biological system described above, these organizational levels are notably similar as opposed to being notably distinct.</p> 

<p>What is so different about these systems?  Why does one system demonstrate so many distinct levels of organization, while another  demonstrates only one level of organization? Why do the organizational levels of one system look so different while those of another look very much the same.   Are these distinctions expressed in the microscopic description of the system?  In the dynamics? In the topology of interaction? In the initial conditions?  Alternatively, given a microscopic description of a system, how do we identify higher level structures in the system? And how do we describe higher level interactions? Is it  possible to derive these structures and interaction rules from the microscopic description?  These are some of the questions that I am trying to address</p>
