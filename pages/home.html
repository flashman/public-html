	<h5> ABOUT </h5> 
	<p> I'm a first year phd student at cornell's center for applied math.  Previously, I studied physics at Reed College, completing my degree in 2008.
	Between 2008 and 2011, I worked as a developer for a startup called 
	<a href="http://intersect.com">Intersect</a>, and as a fabricator for artist <a href="http://academic.reed.edu/art/faculty/ondrizek/">Garaldine Ondrizek</a>.  Along the way, I passed through the <a href"http://santafe.edu/">Santa Fe Institute</a> and have been a bit off ever since.  
	
	I am broadly interested in the development and evolution of of complex systems, ranging from the ideal gases of physics, to the physical and abstract structures of knowledge, and most things in between. In particular, I am trying to better understand hierarchical organization in multi-agent systems, and the communication processes between levels of the hierarchy. See the research section for a bit more on this point.
