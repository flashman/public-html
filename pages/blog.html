		I recently started playing music with people from the program.  (To be fair, they play guitar, mandelin, piano, sing, and I play on boxes like a hobo; keeping it trashy...always trashy).    We've mostly kept it playful and light, jumping between covers and mashups, such as the rugrats theme meets "Float On".  In the last week or two we also happened on some decent original grooves.  M. claims not to be so comfortable on the mandelin as to keep up with our free flow and style, so she took to reading (on a whim) from Cosmos. As you know, Carl Sagen fills a very special hole in my hart; I often look to him when I feel most dejected. And when you listen to his words and his passion, you can help but think, what a nut.  Hopefully we'll get some decent recordings of this stuff at some point.  But until then, here's some stuff of a similar theme that I worked on a few years back.  An excerpt from Glo Opera 2010,  mixed by some friends back in Portland, with vocals by yours truly.

<div class="post"> <h5> FEB 12 2012 &mdash; DONT FORGET THE MAGIC<h5>
	<p> Everyday I am learning to love life a little more.  But this science is a difficult thing.  Its a struggle, everyday.  There's tension in my questions and the expectation that I should find an answer.  But some questions worth asking have no answer.  There are things that are beyond the scope of science.  I hope that everyone feels the magic sometimes.

	(The following is an excerpt from a short writeup I did for my course on BioLocomotion. It serves primarily to frame the model that I was thinking about the other day.) 
	</p>
	<p>
	The maple seed is a winged seed that falls with a characteristic helical motion. And this phenomenon is basically universal among such seeds despite the wide variation between one of these seeds and the next. In the fist module of this course, we considered the simple question: why does this seed fall the way it does, and why do it to it so well. Naively, one might imagine that this auto gyration has something to do with airfoils, the wind turbine, and generally the classical theory of flight. Doesn’t this theory explain why things fly? I guess that this is a plausible starting point; the classical theory of flight is, after all, what we know and understand about flight. But a careful analysis suggests greater subtlety to nature’s design.
	</p>

	<p>
	Perhaps the point is made with a simple experiment. Using a piece of paper and paper clip, try to create the simplest seed that auto-gyrates like like that of the maple. Of course, you could just copy the form of the maple seed at the start to obtain decent results. But to make things interesting, lets say that you start with a 4′ × 4′ piece of paper. Now attach the paper clip somewhere and see how it falls. After each drop, assess the previous performance. Then make a single cut of the paper to improve your lot. With any given cut you may or may not improve the flight performance of your seed—there seems to be a sometimes significant dependence of flight performance in the space of all possible seed shapes. But after several iterations, you may find that you have something vaguely reminiscent of the maple seed, in shape, size and weight.

	Unlike the animal kingdom, the plant kingdom is generally and notably rooted. This constraint presents a unique and significant challenge for species survival. Specifically, offspring must compete for space and resources with previous generations ( and with other offspring of their generation). This is not an inherent problem for understanding the evolution of species; a population need only be sustainable to survive. But suppose that resources are not distributed uniformly, or that the population exists at some time in relatively small number (so there is a well de- fined boundary). For the portion of the population at the boundary of unused resources, there will be a selection bias for mobility. That is, a plant that can move into untapped regions can reproduce with greater abundance.
	</p>
	<p>	
	We might imagine that this is one of the reasons that some seeds developed a capacity for flight. But given the treacherous landscape in the space of all seed morphologies, is it probable for a generic round seed to morph continuously (over many generations) into a form well suited for flight? How does the variation in the fitness landscape of seed forms effect this progression? Is the path direct, or must the seed proceed along a precarious path? We also know that there are many different mechanism for seed flight, from floating to tumbling to auto–gyration. What selection pressures drive seed morphology in one direction versus another. With regard to macroevolution, how are the population dynamics effected by the emergence of a new trait like mobility? It has been suggested that mobility is the primary mechanism for speciation among animals. Does a model supporting the development of plant mobility also demonstrate speciation? These are some of the questions I would be interested in exploring further.
	</p>
	<p>
	One way to understand this system and its population dynamics (as well as the fitness landscape of seeds) is by direct simulation. Rather than try to represent the myriad of obvious and non-abvious factors playing into the evolution of such a system, I will think about this system as a toy model, in the simplest possible terms. So in general I don’t expect such a model to describe the evolution of the maple seed in particular. Rather, the hope is that the model demonstrates some generic features of life today, and provides some insight into the underlying pro- cesses.

	<p> As the last post would suggest, I am trying to connect my work more directly to the biology.  Not having taken a course in biology since tenth grade, I think of the task as non-trivial.  I couldn't seem to find a biology course properly suited to my background (what background).  Instead, I'm taking a course in bio-locomotion this semester offered by the physics department.  Realstically, this is probably the best way for me to enter into the field.	The first unit of the course (which we just finished up) covers the basic theory of flight, and in particular as it relates to gyrating seeds.  The actual physics of the flight turns out to be quite interesting (and has surprisingly little to do with the classical airfoil).  But given my recent interest in evolutionay processes, the more interesting question is how did this novel feature come to be.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
	For the sake of my introduction to evolutionary ecology, I will think about this system in isolation.  This story that I imagine goes something like this.  We start with a collection of seed bearing trees, say a ring of them, on a featureless plain. At each iteration, each tree (sufficiently matured) produces a seed based upon the seed from which it sprung, and subject to small geometric perturbations.  Each seed falls, subject to its varied aerodynamics, and lands at a new location.  Depending on where the seed falls and the resource constraint imposed by the current tree population at the location, each seed sprouts with a some probability.  The seed grows, reaching maturity after some number of iterations, and then starts producing seeds as with the initial population.  At some point, the tree dies, returning its nutrients back to the soil.  I'll try to elaborate on this model next time.

	<p>  Over winter break I got kind of excited about evolution and ecology.  Sure I have been interested in evolution of life in varying degrees and scales for a while, maybe since I went to SFI.  But for the first time I really internalized the shear complexity and uncertainty in the process that drives diversification and novelty among species generally.  But I wonder why it took so long?  I guess it has to do with the popular version of evolution as a process driven by underlying environmental pressures.  What this popular story fails to express is that the forces driving evolution are internal as well as external, that there is a perpetual arms race between species.
	</p>
	
	<p> This new perspective on complexity was brought about by a frivolous late night discussion of the mimic octopus.  As it's name might suggest, the mimic octopus mimics fifteen or so different species (and inanimate objects) in shape, color, texture, and behavior.  Of course, mimicry is common survival mechanism, seen in many different plant and animal species.  What is unique about this instance is that the sustaining mechanism would seem to be rooted in brain function, in the brains capacity for plasticity and simulation, rather than genetic inheritance of physical traits.  (Of course, the physical ability to change shape, color, etc. necessarily accompanies the mental capacity.)

	How does a creature like this come into existence?  How does it know to do the things it does?  Does it understand what it does or are the behaviors hard-wired? To the extent that this creatures seems to demonstrate what we could call intelligence, I can't help but wonder how answers to such questions bere on the evolution of human intelligence.  I probably need to spend some time organizing my thoughts on this problem,  but suffice it to say, I hope to spend more time with this.
