	<p> As the last post would suggest, I am trying to connect my work more directly to the biology.  Not having taken a course in biology since tenth grade, I think of the task as non-trivial.  I couldn't seem to find a biology course properly suited to my background (what background).  Instead, I'm taking a course in bio-locomotion this semester offered by the physics department.  Realstically, this is probably the best way for me to enter into the field.	The first unit of the course (which we just finished up) covers the basic theory of flight, and in particular as it relates to gyrating seeds.  The actual physics of the flight turns out to be quite interesting (and has surprisingly little to do with the classical airfoil).  But given my recent interest in evolutionay processes, the more interesting question is how did this novel feature come to be.

	For the sake of my introduction to evolutionary ecology, I will think about this system in isolation.  This story that I imagine goes something like this.  We start with a collection of seed bearing trees, say a ring of them, on a featureless plain. At each iteration, each tree (sufficiently matured) produces a seed based upon the seed from which it sprung, and subject to small geometric perturbations.  Each seed falls, subject to its varied aerodynamics, and lands at a new location.  Depending on where the seed falls and the resource constraint imposed by the current tree population at the location, each seed sprouts with a some probability.  The seed grows, reaching maturity after some number of iterations, and then starts producing seeds as with the initial population.  At some point, the tree dies, returning its nutrients back to the soil.  I'll try to elaborate on this model next time.

	<p>  Over winter break I got kind of excited about evolution and ecology.  Sure I have been interested in evolution of life in varying degrees and scales for a while, maybe since I went to SFI.  But for the first time I really internalized the shear complexity and uncertainty in the process that drives diversification and novelty among species generally.  But I wonder why it took so long?  I guess it has to do with the popular version of evolution as a process driven by underlying environmental pressures.  What this popular story fails to express is that the forces driving evolution are internal as well as external, that there is a perpetual arms race between species.

	<p> This new perspective on complexity was brought about by a frivolous late night discussion of the mimic octopus.  As it's name might suggest, the mimic octopus mimics fifteen or so different species (and inanimate objects) in shape, color, texture, and behavior.  Of course, mimicry is common survival mechanism, seen in many different plant and animal species.  What is unique about this instance is that the sustaining mechanism would seem to be rooted in brain function, in the brains capacity for plasticity and simulation, rather than genetic inheritance of physical traits.  (Of course, the physical ability to change shape, color, etc. necessarily accompanies the mental capacity.)

	How does a creature like this come into existence?  How does it know to do the things it does?  Does it understand what it does or are the behaviors hard-wired? To the extent that this creatures seems to demonstrate what we could call intelligence, I can't help but wonder how answers to such questions bere on the evolution of human intelligence.  I probably need to spend some time organizing my thoughts on this problem,  but suffice it to say, I hope to spend more time with this.
