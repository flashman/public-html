<p> I'm a first year phd student at cornell's center for applied math.  
Before that, I worked as a web developer for <a href="http://intersect.com">Intersect.com</a>. 
Before that, I studied physics at Reed College.

<p>In 2007 I did an REU at the Santa Fe Institute.  They sometimes talk about drinking the cool-aid; I think I drank the cool-aid.
I investigated theoretical aspects of the metabolism-first scenario for the origin of life.  
I considered the specific question: Why, given the great variety of possible geochemical reactions, are so few core metabolic pathways observed in life today?
This question has rattled around inside my head for the last five years, and for me remains one of the most fundamental questions of science. It reminds us of the end game of science: to understand our place in the universe, and thereby to better understand ourselves. But in considering this question, the question has evolved, to a broader concern for the general problem of complexity: how do simple things become complex.
