<div class="post"> <h5>FEB 2 2012</h5>
  <p>Welcome to 2013...I hear this year's going to be a good one. Anyway, for the last several months I have been working with Paul Ginsparg on some entropic methods for identifying &quote; interesting &quote; word usage in the <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>.  While the methods show some potential, there are still some problems and the project is stagnating.  It's hard for me to say for sure why this is the case.  I actually do find the questions very interesting in the abstract.  But in practice, the work has not maintained my interest as much as I would hope.  This is in part simply do to the hardwired positive and negative feedback mechanisms of research.   When things aren't going well, we struggle get frusterated board disinterested distracted discouraged.  Then the work deteriorates further and things only get worse.  It's a cycle i've been in for a while.  I'm still not sure how to get out of it.  I think it's the same kind of cycle that makes depression the sink hole that it is...<a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~moore/">Cris Moore</a> once told me that good research requres a certain mental disposition, one full of unreasonable optimism and deep self-loathing.  The first keeps you light on your toes and the second keeps you honest.</p>

  <p>One of my longstanding frusterations with the research project has been the programming language itself.  I know this is a petty kind of thing, but not something to discount completely.   I guess python is the norm for scientific computing these days. Not really serious numerical computing, but the everyday high level programming language of choice.  Ok, sure there is matlab and mathematica and R and things like that, but you know what I mean.  Anyway, I really don't like python all that much, and the indentation just kills me---I want some freaking brackets or an end statment.  The problem is that I learned to program in ruby, and ruby is great.  I would ofcourse just use ruby for all my computing needs, but as the theory goes ruby is a language by and for software developors.  It totally reasonable, and a pleasure to code in, and cake to install/maintain/extend.  But it lacks support and optimization for most of what scientist want to do.  Python on the other hand is a language by and for scientists.<p>

  <p>After bitching abunch about how slow my code was, I finally went ahead and wrote some c extensions:</p>
  <pre>

  /* cextensionsmodule.c */

  #include <Python.h>

  double _xlog2x(double d)
  {
    if (d <= 0)
      return 0;
    else
      return d*log(d)/log(2.0);
  }

  double _p(double n, double m, double p)
  {
    if (n<0 || m<0 || p<0 || p>1)
      return 0;
    else
      return exp(lgamma(n+1)-lgamma(n-m+1)-lgamma(m+1)+m*log(p)+(n-m)*log(1.0-p));
  }

  double _pxlog2x(double n, double m, double p)
  {
    return _p(n,m,p)*_xlog2x(m/n);
  }

  static PyObject* expectedentropy(PyObject* self, PyObject* args)
  {
    int i,m,len;
    double N,n,h,M;
    PyObject* obj;
    PyObject* seq;
    PyObject* item;

    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "Odd", &obj, &N, &n ))
      return NULL;

    seq = PySequence_Fast(obj, "expected a sequence");
    len = PySequence_Size(obj);

    h=0;
    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      item = PyList_GET_ITEM(seq, i);
      if (PyFloat_Check(item)){
        M = PyFloat_AsDouble(item);
      }
      else if (PyInt_Check(item)){
        M = (double) PyInt_AsLong(item);
      }
      for(m = 1; m <= (int)( n < M ? n : M); m++){
        h+=_pxlog2x(n,(double)m,M/N);
      }
    }

    Py_DECREF(seq);
    return Py_BuildValue("d",-h);
  }

  static PyMethodDef CExtensionsMethods[] = {
    {"expectedentropy", expectedentropy, METH_VARARGS, "Calculate expected entropy."},
    {NULL, NULL, 0, NULL}
  };

  PyMODINIT_FUNC initmyextensions(void)
  {
    (void) Py_InitModule("cextensions", CExtensionsMethods);
  }

</pre>

  <p>To build the extension, you also need a setup file:</p>
  <pre>

  # setup.py

  from distutils.core import setup, Extension
  module1 = Extension('cextensions', sources = ['cextensionsmodule.c'])
    
  setup (name = 'PackageName',
      version = '1.0',
      description = 'This is a demo package',
      ext_modules = [module1])
  </pre>
  <p>Finaly, run the following command in the terminal to build the extension.</p>
  <pre>

 money-cash$  python setup.py build
  </pre>
  <p>You can move the resulting .so file into the working directory when your done.  To use the extension, just include <code>import cextensions</code> in your python.  This simple extension gave me performance increases upwards of 10x.</p>

Fortunately it doesn't grant you immediate access to other users files.  But you do end up with admin privladges.  So maybe that access isnt so far away.

    <li>Turn on your Mac and boot in single-user mode by pressing Apple+S.</li>
    <li>Once it boots into single-user mode, you have to mount the hard disk in write mode, delete the <code>.AppleSetupDone</code> file under <code>/var/db/</code> (note the dot before the filename because it's hidden) and reboot. Prior to this, we'll check the hard disk consistency with <code>fsck</code> So, type this:

	<p> Following additional experiments with random shapes, similar to those described in the previous post, I obtained the following more complete (and somewhat less interesting) plot.  As before, the random autogyros are plotted in red.  In addition, rollers are plotted in green, undulators are plotted in blue, and gliders are plotted in yellow.   Trend lines for each of these aerodynamic groups (excepts for the gliders) are provided and colored accordingly.  To draw a more direct comparison with Auspurger's original study, her original trend lines (dashed) are also included.  With this larger data set, the curious autogyro trend line from before returns to a more plausible form.

	<p> This is quick update on the seed project I described a month or two ago.  I previously described a general interest in trying to understand how a highly specialized object of nature, the maple seed, might have come to exist.  With that general interest in mind, I focused on the following (slightly) more focused question: How do the aerodynamics of random shapes compare to the aerodynamics of real seeds?
	</p>
	<p>  Before saying anything about random shapes, it would be useful to know something about the aerodynamics of real seeds. C Auspurger provides an accessible account of the aerodynamics of flying seeds in <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2444078">Morphology And Dispersal Potential Of Wind-Dispersed Diaspores Of Neotropical Trees</a>, 1986.  I wont review the details of this paper in here.  But in brief, Auspurger provides a concise classification of the different kinds of flying seeds observed among 30 or so neotropical tree species.  The classification includes a classification of seed morphologies and corresponding flight dynamics eg auto-gyrating floating etc.  Flight regularities within and between seed classes were quantified. (See the figure below.) This study serves as a template for my investigation of aerodynamics of random shapes, as well as the reference for relating my results back to the real biology.          
	</p>
	 
	<div class="media">
		<img src="assets/blog/auspurger-windloadingVsVelocity.jpg"></img>
	</div>
	 
	 <p> To address the question given above, I generated several dozen random shapes (generate your own random shapes <a href="code/seed/">here</a>), added some additional weight, and dropped them.  Simple enough.  For each of these random shapes I measured its mass, falling time, and classified its mode of flight.  Following the work of Auspurger, I then plotted wing-loading vs rate of decent for each of the random shapes.  This plot appears below.  Of particular interest are the class of auto-gyrating shapes, plotted in red.  The random shapes generally follow the trend of real seeds shown above: increased wing loading increases the rate of descent. But the class of autogyros stands out.  This class appears to demonstrate the opposite trend: increased wing loading decreases the descent velocity.                	`

	<p>
		In the research section, I outlined a rather substantial question regarding orderly features of complex systems: Why hierarchy and how?  I think hierarchy is an important feature of complex systems and worthy of questioning,  but I don't claim to have a good idea about how  to think of  this problem or pursue it in a meaning full way.  My first instinct was simply to collect some toy models that demonstrate this feature, to build intuition.  (These are the models I have started accumulating throughout the site.)  Maybe there's some value to this, but not surprisingly, only if I follow through with the harder mathematical analysis...which leaves me where I started, how do I think mathematically about this question of hierarchy. 	
	</p>
	<p>
		Having some working models has allowed me to think more about dynamics, and specifically the developmental process that transforms a random or uniform system into a structured system.  I actually think this might be a useful perspective on the problem.  After all, no complex system simply exists. Rather each is born into existence via a generative process.  Hierarchical features, in particular, would seem to rely heavily on this generative nature of the system in the sense that high level structure are typically dependent on the existence of low level processes.  (Along this line of thinking we butt up against a distinction in the class of complex systems.  This is the distinction between  dynamical systems with constant number of actors and dynamical systems with reproduction. For the later case, the consideration of development applies to both individuals and the system as a whole...I will hopefully return to this point another day.)  This perspective stands in some contrast to the standard approches of dynamical systems, and (equilibrium) statistical physics. For each we typically ignore transients and instead focus on equilibrium behavior.        
	</p>
	<p>
		If the developmental process is worth thinking about, how should we think about it?  Two ideas come to mind. First, we may describe low level interactions/behaviors in terms of combinatorics.  Given a population of varied elementary system agents (for a field, the agents may be infinitesimal), which agents can interact, and how many different products can they form?  For  example, take a system of non interacting particles.  In this case, the combinatorics of the possible interactions are trivial: nothing interacts with anything and there are no results. Alternatively, we might think of this system as a kind of identity: an agent only interacts with itself to yield itself.  On the other hand consider the combinatorics of word combinations (subject to the norms of modern communication). Though not every word combination is allowed,  many are allowed and provide for new meaning.  Or consider the system of symbols generated by dots lines and curves.  For this system, different combinations yield letters, and collectively alphabets.  Second we may describe low level interactions in terms of the interaction's information processing abilities.  Roughly, how does an interaction effect the information content of the system locally or as a whole? Is the process constructive or destructive or neutral?  And how should we think about information in this setting?

		Ok.  After spending way to much time on some stupid ass bug,  I finished coding up a first version of the spatially extended Rock Paper Scissors population model (with random mutation and asynchronous update).  Need to do all the work I wasn't doing, so I will save the details for later.  But it's worth noting up front that the entire simulation runs in javascript via the processing.js library that I mentioned a few days ago.  Its a bit hard on the javascript engine (I recommend running in it Chrome or Safari), but considering that it performs on the order of 600,000 iterations per second, it works better than expected.  Given that the processing development environment provides for simple generation of java applets, it might be better to embed it directly(?).  You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/flashman/rock-paper-scissor">here</a>.
		<br>
		<br>
		Update:  After playing around with the javascript version of the simulation, I find it sluggish. So I've replaced it with a java applet. Or just check out the code on github.

		I've been wondering how best to include mathematics on the web.  There's mathml, but as far as I can tell that sucks.  Maybe it's better to stick with pdfs?   I recently came across the javascript project <a href="http://www.mathjax.org">mathjax</a>.  The library actually parses and renders TeX directly in the body text.  It handles inline math: \( -\nabla p + \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} = 0 \), as well as the equation environment:  
		$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty{e}^{-x^2/2}dx=\sqrt{2\pi}.$$
It also offers a nice interface for the reader to export equations and see the original TeX (just right click).

		Looks like i've wasted another day playing with the internet.  But I really am taken by how easy it is to create interactive simulations via html and javascript (and a few javascript libraries).  I guess it's nice that all the pieces of technology are learning to play together, but what I'm really taken by is the prospects for communicating ideas (say scientific models) in more compelling, transparent, and distributed ways.  What if every model you ever saw treated in a paper was readily available online, not just in the form of source code that you may or may be able to run, but complete and live.  (For that matter, why doesn't arxiv host supplemental material like source code...and for that matter why doesn't arxiv serve as a code hub, like github, for scientific simulations.)

		I threw this little guy together a year or two ago when I was learning this open source prototyping language called <a href="http://processing.org">processing</a>. (And here's the processing <a href="processing/circles.pde">source code</a>.) Today I stumbled upon <a href="http://processingjs.org">processing.js</a>, a javascript library that converts the processing source code directly into javascript.  It's not clear to me that it doesn't make more sense to just write javascript.  But it's certainly easier to drop the processing code directly onto the page.

		I recently started playing music with people from the program.  (To be fair, they play guitar, mandelin, piano, sing, and I play on boxes like a hobo; keeping it trashy...always trashy).    We've mostly kept it playful and light, jumping between covers and mashups, such as the rugrats theme meets "Float On".  In the last week or two we also happened on some decent original grooves.  M. claims not to be so comfortable on the mandelin as to keep up with our free flow and style, so she took to reading (on a whim) from Cosmos. As you know, Carl Sagen fills a very special hole in my hart; I often look to him when I feel most dejected. And when you listen to his words and his passion, you can't help but think: what a nut.  Hopefully we'll get some decent recordings of this stuff at some point.  But until then, here's some stuff of a similar theme that I worked on a few years back.

	<p>
	(The following is an excerpt from a short writeup I did for my course on BioLocomotion. It serves primarily to frame the model that I was thinking about the other day.) 
	</p>
	<p>
	The maple seed is a winged seed that falls with a characteristic helical motion. And this phenomenon is basically universal among such seeds despite the wide variation between one of these seeds and the next. In the fist module of this course, we considered the simple question: why does this seed fall the way it does, and why do it to it so well. Naively, one might imagine that this auto gyration has something to do with airfoils, the wind turbine, and generally the classical theory of flight. Doesn’t this theory explain why things fly? I guess that this is a plausible starting point; the classical theory of flight is, after all, what we know and understand about flight. But a careful analysis suggests greater subtlety to nature’s design.
	</p>
	
	<div class="media">
		<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WLBaIf3ofTs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	</div>
	
	<p>
	Perhaps the point is made with a simple experiment. Using a piece of paper and paper clip, try to create the simplest seed that auto-gyrates like like that of the maple. Of course, you could just copy the form of the maple seed at the start to obtain decent results. But to make things interesting, lets say that you start with a 4′ × 4′ piece of paper. Now attach the paper clip somewhere and see how it falls. After each drop, assess the previous performance. Then make a single cut of the paper to improve your lot. With any given cut you may or may not improve the flight performance of your seed—there seems to be a sometimes significant dependence of flight performance in the space of all possible seed shapes. But after several iterations, you may find that you have something vaguely reminiscent of the maple seed, in shape, size and weight.
	</p>
	<p>
	Unlike the animal kingdom, the plant kingdom is generally and notably rooted. This constraint presents a unique and significant challenge for species survival. Specifically, offspring must compete for space and resources with previous generations ( and with other offspring of their generation). This is not an inherent problem for understanding the evolution of species; a population need only be sustainable to survive. But suppose that resources are not distributed uniformly, or that the population exists at some time in relatively small number (so there is a well de- fined boundary). For the portion of the population at the boundary of unused resources, there will be a selection bias for mobility. That is, a plant that can move into untapped regions can reproduce with greater abundance.
	</p>
	<p>	
	We might imagine that this is one of the reasons that some seeds developed a capacity for flight. But given the treacherous landscape in the space of all seed morphologies, is it probable for a generic round seed to morph continuously (over many generations) into a form well suited for flight? How does the variation in the fitness landscape of seed forms effect this progression? Is the path direct, or must the seed proceed along a precarious path? We also know that there are many different mechanism for seed flight, from floating to tumbling to auto–gyration. What selection pressures drive seed morphology in one direction versus another. With regard to macroevolution, how are the population dynamics effected by the emergence of a new trait like mobility? It has been suggested that mobility is the primary mechanism for speciation among animals. Does a model supporting the development of plant mobility also demonstrate speciation? These are some of the questions I would be interested in exploring further.
	</p>
	<p>
	One way to understand this system and its population dynamics (as well as the fitness landscape of seeds) is by direct simulation. Rather than try to represent the myriad of obvious and non-abvious factors playing into the evolution of such a system, I will think about this system as a toy model, in the simplest possible terms. So in general I don’t expect such a model to describe the evolution of the maple seed in particular. Rather, the hope is that the model demonstrates some generic features of life today, and provides some insight into the underlying pro- cesses.
	</p>

<div class="post"> <h5> FEB 5 2012 </h5> 
	<p> As the last post would suggest, I am trying to connect my work more directly to the biology.  Not having taken a course in biology since tenth grade, I think of the task as non-trivial.  I couldn't seem to find a biology course properly suited to my background (what background).  Instead, I'm taking a course in bio-locomotion this semester offered by the physics department.  Realstically, this is probably the best way for me to enter into the field.	The first unit of the course (which we just finished up) covers the basic theory of flight, and in particular as it relates to gyrating seeds.  The actual physics of the flight turns out to be quite interesting (and has surprisingly little to do with the classical airfoil).  But given my recent interest in evolutionay processes, the more interesting question is how did this novel feature come to be.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
	For the sake of my introduction to evolutionary ecology, I will think about this system in isolation.  This story that I imagine goes something like this.  We start with a collection of seed bearing trees, say a ring of them, on a featureless plain. At each iteration, each tree (sufficiently matured) produces a seed based upon the seed from which it sprung, and subject to small geometric perturbations.  Each seed falls, subject to its varied aerodynamics, and lands at a new location.  Depending on where the seed falls and the resource constraint imposed by the current tree population at the location, each seed sprouts with a some probability.  The seed grows, reaching maturity after some number of iterations, and then starts producing seeds as with the initial population.  At some point, the tree dies, returning its nutrients back to the soil.  I'll try to elaborate on this model next time. 
	</p>
</div>

<div class="post"> <h5> FEB 4 2012 </h5> 
	<p>  Over winter break I got kind of excited about evolution and ecology.  Sure I have been interested in evolution of life in varying degrees and scales for a while, maybe since I went to SFI.  But for the first time I really internalized the shear complexity and uncertainty in the process that drives diversification and novelty among species generally.  But I wonder why it took so long?  I guess it has to do with the popular version of evolution as a process driven by underlying environmental pressures.  What this popular story fails to express is that the forces driving evolution are internal as well as external, that there is a perpetual arms race between species.
	</p>
	
	<p> This new perspective on complexity was brought about by a frivolous late night discussion of the mimic octopus.  As it's name might suggest, the mimic octopus mimics fifteen or so different species (and inanimate objects) in shape, color, texture, and behavior.  Of course, mimicry is common survival mechanism, seen in many different plant and animal species.  What is unique about this instance is that the sustaining mechanism would seem to be rooted in brain function, in the brains capacity for plasticity and simulation, rather than genetic inheritance of physical traits.  (Of course, the physical ability to change shape, color, etc. necessarily accompanies the mental capacity.)

	How does a creature like this come into existence?  How does it know to do the things it does?  Does it understand what it does or are the behaviors hard-wired? To the extent that this creatures seems to demonstrate what we could call intelligence, I can't help but wonder how answers to such questions bere on the evolution of human intelligence.  I probably need to spend some time organizing my thoughts on this problem,  but suffice it to say, I hope to spend more time with this.
