	<h5> ABOUT </h5> 
	<p> I'm a first year phd student at cornell's center for applied math.  Previously, I studied physics at Reed College, completing my degree in 2008.
	Between 2008 and 2011, I worked as a developer for a startup called 
	<a href="http://intersect.com">Intersect</a>, and as a fabricator for artist <a href="http://academic.reed.edu/art/faculty/ondrizek/">Garaldine Ondrizek</a>.  Along the way, I passed through the Santa Fe Institute and have been a bit off ever since.  
	
	I am broadly interested in the behavior of complex systems, 
	ranging from statistical mechanics of ideal gases, to the evolution of knowledge, and most things in between.  For me it really is the diversity of phenomenon that I find fascinating together with the striking similarities among such diversity. In particular, I am trying to better understand the formation of coherent structure, novel function, and hierarchical organization in multi-agent systems.  See the research section for a bit more on this point.
