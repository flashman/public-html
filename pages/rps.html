		Ok.  After spending way to much time on some stupid ass bug,  I finished coding up a first version of the spatially extended Rock Paper Scissors population model (with random mutation and asynchronous update).  Need to do all the work I wasn't doing, so I will save the details for later.  But it's worth noting up front that the entire simulation runs in javascript via the processing.js library that I mentioned a few days ago.  Its a bit hard on the javascript engine (I recommend running in it Chrome or Safari), but considering that it performs on the order of 600,000 iterations per second, it works better than expected.  Given that the processing development environment provides for simple generation of java applets, it might be better to embed it directly(?).  You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/flashman/rock-paper-scissor">here</a>.

		Update:  After playing around with the javascript version of the simulation, I find it sluggish. So I've replaced it with a java applet, or just check out the code on github.
