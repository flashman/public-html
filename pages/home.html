<p> I'm a first year phd student at cornell's center for applied math.  
Before that, I worked for a startup called <a href="http://intersect.com">Intersect.com</a>. 
Before that, I studied physics at Reed College, finishing up in 2008.  I am generally interested in complex systems, 
from chemical self organization to the evolution of knowledge.
With my work I am trying to better understand the formation of coherent structure and hierarchical organization in agent-based systems.
