	<h5> ABOUT </h5> 
	<p> I'm a second year phd student at cornell's center for applied math.  Previously, I studied physics at Reed College, completing my degree in 2008.
	Between 2008 and 2011, I worked as a developer for a startup called 
	<a href="http://intersect.com">Intersect</a>, and as a fabricator for artist <a href="http://academic.reed.edu/art/faculty/ondrizek/">Garaldine Ondrizek</a>.  Along the way, I passed through the <a href"http://santafe.edu/">Santa Fe Institute</a> and have been a bit off ever since.
	</p>  
	
	<p>
	I am broadly interested in the development and evolution of complex systems, ranging from the ideal gases of physics, to the physical and abstract structures of knowledge, and most things in between. To be a bit more specific, I am trying to better understand hierarchical organization of multi-agent systems, and the ways that different levels of the hierarchy interact with each other. See the research section for more on this point.

	<p>
	When I'm not up to my eyeballs in work, you can find me out making <a onClick="window.location ='#p=art';">art</a>, playing around on the <a href="http://bonerbucks.org/">internet</a>, or drinking coffee.  Im also quite fond of the <a href="#p=bm">desert</a>.
